# Battleship DTR Memo

## AJ Tran and Grant Dempsey

## Summary of DTR meeting

Our first meeting was right after classes ended when we got paired.

We looked at the rubric together and discussed the what we need to get started.

We checked in with each other as people and then decided to meet tomorrow.

We have worked together before in Mod0 and are positive that our strengths will carry us through all iterations of the project.

- We expect to:
  - Communicate very frequently
  - Meet at least once a day
  - Revisit the DTR memo when necessary
  - Drink whiskey together one day
